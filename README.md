# Python script for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic generative model commonly used for topic modeling in natural language processing. It identifies hidden topics within a collection of documents and represents each document as a mixture of those topics. Each topic, in turn, is represented as a distribution over words. 

In this script for example, eeveral scientific paper abstracts will be provided as input to the model. The LDA algorithm, by analyzing the words in each abstract, will identify the words that best cluster the various papers. As output, we will obtain a classification of all the abstracts into latent subgroups, each with its own distinctive characteristics (eg Bayesian optimization, longitudinal anlysis...).


The model is not limited to textual learning but is also applied in fields such as evolutionary biology and bio-medicine, clinical psychology, mental health, and social science.


### Key Concepts:
1) LDA assumes that each document is composed of multiple topics, where each topic contributes to the document with a certain proportion. For example, a news article could be 70% "politics" and 30% "economics."

2) Each topic is characterized by a probability distribution over words. For example, a "sports" topic might assign high probabilities to words like "game," "team," and "score."
